There are two cases of interest configured by this variable.

- Case (A) is when at least one function argument is on the same
  line as the function name.
- Case (B) is the opposite (no arguments are on the same line as
  the function name).  Note that the body of macros is not
  affected by this variable, it is always indented by
  `lisp-body-indent' (default 2) spaces.

Note that this variable configures the indentation of function
forms (and function-like macros), it does not affect macros that
already use special indentation rules.

The possible values for this variable are keywords indicating how
to indent function forms.

    `always-align' - Follow the same rules as `lisp-mode'.  All
    args are vertically aligned with the first arg in case (A),
    and vertically aligned with the function name in case (B).

         merge
         some-coll)

        (reduce merge
          some-coll)
        (reduce
          merge
          some-coll)

    `align-arguments' - Case (A) is indented like `lisp', and
    case (B) is indented like a macro body.

If the current line is in a call to a Clojure function with a
non-nil property `cljm-indent-function', that specifies how to do
the indentation.

The property value can be

- `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style;
- an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially
  like ordinary function arguments and then indent any further
  arguments like a body;
- a function to call just as this function was called.
